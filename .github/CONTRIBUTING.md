## Pull Requests
At Rangle.io we use a fork-and-branch strategy for pull requests, with some modifications for our internal tooling. To follow this strategy, please do the following:

- Fork the repo you would like to contribute to.

- Clone that fork to your local machine.

- Add our repo as a new remote called upstream. <br>
`git remote add upstream git@github.com:rangle/[repo_name].git`

- Work on a branch that is descriptively named. (We prefer the `chore/fix/feat` convention)
