## Looking for a tech stack that used to be here?

Maintaining example apps and starters for all the different stacks has proven
to be a challenge. We are therefore making a more minimal set of starters that
reflects our current practice and which are not burdened by the reasonably
complex example app.

We're also watching with interest development work for
[create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) and
[angular-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli) and will likely adopt
them in some form soon.

As the existing tech stacks are pruned from the rangle-starter program, we are
renaming the old repos to \*.example and we will be maintaining them in a more
static way going forward.

Here are the old stacks that have been spun into standalone examples:

### angular2-redux-example

(based on https://github.com/rangle/angular2-redux-example)
Angular 2, redux, typescript, webpack and associated utilities.
Demo app: https://angular2-redux-example.herokuapp.com
